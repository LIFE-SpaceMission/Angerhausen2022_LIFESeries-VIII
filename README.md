Spectra with and without phosphine for various planetary cases used in the LIFE VIII paper (Angerhausen D., Ottiger M., Dannert F., Miguel Y., Sousa-Silva C., Kammerer J., Menti F., et al., 2023, AsBio, 23, 183. doi:10.1089/ast.2022.0010)

## Description of the different subdirectories:  


  

- `Jupiterlike/`  

	Contains the spectra with and without phosphine (labeled 'noPH3') for the warm Jupiter modeled in the publication (Figure 5).  Units: Wavelength (microns) vs  Flux (W/m2/m) at the top of the atmosphere. Source: Yamila Miguel

  

- `SuperEarths/` 

	Contains the spectra with (labeled 'with_PH3') and without phosphine (labeled 'wo_PH3') for the Super Earths modeled in the publication. Both the H2-rich case (labeled 'H2', corresponding to Figure 3) and CO2-rich case (labeled 'CO2', corresponding to Figure 4). Units: Wavenumber vs Contrast. See Figures 6/7 from Sousa-Silva et al. 2019.
  

- `Venuslike/` 

	Contains the spectra with (labeled 'ph3') and without phosphine (labeled 'no_ph3') for the warm Jupiter modeled in the publication (Figure 2).  Units: Wavelength (microns, 1st column) vs  contrast (4th column, must be multiplied by stellar flux, also in the file as the 2nd column)
